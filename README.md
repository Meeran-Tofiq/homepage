# Homepage

This is a mock up of what the homepage of some website my look like. While creating this, I made sure to make is as accessible as possible, and ensured it worked for any and all screen sizes without affecting the experience of the page.

# Motivation
This is a project that was made for the "Advanced HTML and CSS Course" of The Odin Project. It was made to demonstrate the ablity to make responsive images, while ensuring acessiblity for people who might need it.
